Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob

This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews using the TextBlob library in Python.

Overview

The main steps in the sentiment analysis process are:

1. Load and preprocess the data
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove HTML tags and escape sequences
   - Remove punctuation
   - Convert text to lowercase

2. Remove stopwords
   - Use the NLTK stopwords corpus
   - Customize the stopword list by removing 'no' and 'not'

3. Perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob
   - Calculate the polarity score for each review
   - Map the polarity score to a binary sentiment label (positive or negative)

4. Evaluate the model
   - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- textblob

Usage

1. Install the required packages:
